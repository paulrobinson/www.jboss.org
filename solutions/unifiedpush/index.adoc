=== Overview
The Unified Push server allows developers to send native push messages to Apple's Push Notification Service (APNS) and Google's Cloud Messaging (GCM).
It features a built-in administration console that makes it easy for developers to create and manage push related aspects of their applications for any mobile development environment.
Includes client SDKs (iOS, Android, & Cordova), and a REST based sender service with an available Java sender library.
